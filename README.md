# openspace-api-python
Python library to interface with [OpenSpace](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace) using sockets.

## Work in progress
Both the API and libary are still very much work in progress, and are subject to change.

### Python in terminal
https://github.com/OpenSpace/openspace-api-python/blob/master/example/example.py provides an example of how to connect from a python script using sockets. To run it, run `python -m example.example` from the working directory in the terminal.
